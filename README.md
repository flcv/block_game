## TL;DR

**When:** August 2020\
**Why:** Personal amusement\
**How:** ES6, HTML5, CSS3\
**Development time (approx.):** 2-4 days

## Longform
I recommend using Chrome to play the game, not Firefox, as it delivers better frames.

I enjoyed playing platformer games when I was younger, and decided to write my own. Game development is certainly harder than one would first think. 

Begin the game by clicking on the canvas, then moving the player with WASD. Blocks will fall from the top of the screen and stack on top of each other, while water rises from the bottom of the screen. There is no death condition, but the idea is to stay on screen by jumping on the blocks. If you want some help, you can spawn extra blocks by pressing "X".

The game is still unfinished and there are several known bugs, especially to do with hit detection, as well as holding W, but I am proud of the fact that it uses no third-party game-dev libraries and was developed in a short period of time. In future I think it would be fun to add a basic physics engine and more complex falling shapes.
